Imagine Electron, but instead of running Javascript (bad) on a bundled browser engine (bad),
it runs WebAssembly (fast) on a lightweight runtime (yipee), with some modern flexibility and convenience to boot.  

I'm suspending my work on Veneto as I flesh out this idea, which has been calling my name for months now.

This is going to be a big undertaking, and this repo may change hands at some point,
but if you're interested in collaborating, reach out!
